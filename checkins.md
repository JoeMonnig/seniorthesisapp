## Week 1 Summary (09/08/2025)

### This week I worked on:

Building hypothesises for multiple possible project ideas for viable and doable projects.

### This week I learned:

My limitations of what I could do within my given timeframe to get this project completed.

### My successes this week were:

Chose a few ideas for guidance on and to refine for specific requirements.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Not all project ideas made complete sense and learning how to refine and build complete ideas with competant and thoughtful requirements to have a baseline to continue building.

## Week 2 Summary (09/15/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Made a decision to put my full effort into researching and working on ideas for a project idea I am calling a "Personal Finance Visualization and Management Tool" and began teaching myself how to use Electron with my application.

### This week I learned:

How to establish and start a project and effectively start a package.json and project overview and installing all the necessary programs for it.

### My successes this week were:

Everything worked the first time with a few syntax based warnings in beginning the project.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

This week and going into next week I am challenging myself to learn how to implement version control through GitHub and link the versions without needing to manually input everything.

## Week 3 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Build 95% of what the application's databse will become (minor tweaks and references might end up getting changed). Built up the beginnings of the main page and login page for new users to access.

### This week I learned:

How to effectively upload and commit the majority of changes to GitHub. In addition I figured out how to secure accounts and use hashing to increase security while using multiple pages through electron.

### My successes this week were:

Building more of my project and streamlining how to organize and sort all the data.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Figuring out how to organize the data was tough as the data names are very similar as they all involve different types of money. I had to force myself to slow down enough to be able to go step by step and achieve my goal.

---

## Week 4 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

I read through more syntax and annotations of code in regards to the electron application. Continued editing variables and removing unnecessary variables to streamline and make sure the database has all the variables it might need.

### This week I learned:

How to create multiple pages for an application that can be navigated through one after another.

### My successes this week were:

I figured out a simplier way to go about encrypting and hashing passwords for user login and verification.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

With reading through so much material I feel that I wasted my time reading possibly incorrect or not what I needed in terms of resources.

---

## Week 5 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Annotating some of my code to provide documentation with descriptions for when I upload commits to GitHub.

### This week I learned:

How to annotate effectively without over explaining or providing too much information to comments

### My successes this week were:

Making my annotations make sense and having them make sense to someone with multiple years of experience

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Missed doing elevator pitch so holding off on writing any more visual(javascript and HTML) code just incase changes are needing to be made that would revert my progress significantly.

---

## Week 6 Summary (10/13/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Refining my tabling and structuring to consolidate down from 12 table total to less than half as many.

### This week I learned:

Mass amounts of data can be useful but there are always ways to simplify or make it run with greater efficiency.

### My successes this week were:

Met with Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Zak for eleveator pitch planning for my public pitch to the whole class(was scheduled for 10/20/25 but rescheduled to 10/27/25 due to class conflicts) and got my pitch and project approved.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

How to refine and continue to have a structure in a database while it still makes enough sense.
